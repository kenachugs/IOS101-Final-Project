Evaluations:
Cloth Trading: You could make an app where people buy and sell clothes, using your skills in coding and understanding of buying and selling. The tricky parts are getting enough users, making sure people trust the app, and handling all the items listed.

Fast Food Delivery: Building an app that helps people order and get food delivered is a big technical project and matches your coding interests, especially with maps and timing. But, lots of big companies do this already, so it’s tough to stand out and would need lots of resources.

Picture Manager: You can create an app to help people organize their photos better, using your knowledge in iOS and image tech. The hard part is that many popular apps exist already, so yours would need to do something truly special to get users’ attention.

Final App Chosen:
Cloth Trading
